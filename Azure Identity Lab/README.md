# Azure AD / MFA Identity Troubleshooting Lab

### 📌 Overview  
This project simulates cloud identity administration and MFA troubleshooting for **SkyPoint Logistics**, a company migrating fully to Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD). The lab explores how identity issues occur in cloud environments and how Tier 1–2 support technicians diagnose and resolve them using the Azure portal, sign-in logs, authentication methods, and conditional access.

---

## 🧩 Skills Demonstrated
- Azure AD user and identity administration  
- MFA enforcement, resets, and authentication method management  
- Sign-in log analysis for failed or risky authentications  
- Conditional Access evaluation and troubleshooting  
- Cloud-only user lifecycle operations  
- Diagnosing misconfigured MFA or blocked sign-ins  
- Understanding error codes and authentication flows

## 🚀 What This Lab Covers  
This lab provides hands-on experience with:

- Creating and configuring cloud-only Azure AD user accounts  
- Assigning Azure administrator roles appropriately  
- Enforcing MFA using Security Defaults or Conditional Access  
- Breaking and repairing MFA configurations to replicate real incidents  
- Reviewing sign-in logs to identify root causes of failed authentications  
- Testing Conditional Access policies (e.g., trusted locations, MFA requirements)  
- Disabling, revoking, restoring, and reviewing user access as part of lifecycle governance  

All scenarios reflect identity issues frequently escalated to help desk and Tier 2 support teams.
